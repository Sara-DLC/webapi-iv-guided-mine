## Deployment notes

## Jargon

_"Single Responsibility Principle"_

Do one thing really well, Only one reason to change.

## Deployment

- extract configuration into invironment variables
- set up continous Deployment from Github to Heroku
    -commit and push to Github and the api gets updatd on Heroku.
- add a "start" script to `package.json`
- make port dynamic
